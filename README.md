# 🛡️ Jerome Andrew K — Portfolio  

Welcome to my digital playground where cybersecurity collides with creativity. This isn’t just a portfolio—it’s a live lab of experiments, break-fix cycles, and cyber-themed design built to showcase my journey in security research & development.

## 🔍 About This Portfolio  

Think of this site as a **cyber lab with style**: sleek animations, hacker-inspired UI, and interactive elements that make exploration fun. It’s my way of showing how I mix **technical depth** with **creative design**—whether I’m hardening systems, breaking Linux (again), or hacking my way into new knowledge.
